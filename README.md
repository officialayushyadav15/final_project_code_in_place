# 🧠 Quiz App – Tkinter Based Multiple Choice Quiz

The **Quiz App** is a simple desktop program created using Python’s Tkinter library. It offers a fun and interactive quiz experience on general knowledge questions. Designed with a clean dark theme to reduce eye fatigue, it ensures smooth readability and an enjoyable user experience.

Each time the quiz is played, the questions and options are shuffled to make it feel fresh and new. The application provides **instant feedback** for each response, and also includes a **hint** feature to encourage users to think more deeply.
